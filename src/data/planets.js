If life exists or existed, evidences could be found in his subsurface, away from the actual harsh surface conditions.\n There is also water on Mars. Today, liquid water cannot exist on his surface due to temperatures and pressure. Water on Mars exists almost exclusively as water ice, located in the polar ice caps and under the surface. The habitable zone which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars, seems to give a possibility for life to have existed there. A theory tells us that a small amount of liquid water could exist for a short time when Mars goes into the habitable zone. \n Today, researches are still in progress and could lead to the discovery of life on Mars in the incoming years.\n",

Venus temperature and atmospheric pressure make life - with actual knowledges - unlikely. Some scientists speculated that resistant microorganisms may exist. \n The clouds of Venus contain water and carbon dioxide : combined with sunlight, those molecules are the prerequisites for photosynthesis. Researches are currently underway. \n Even if human life on Venus seems impossible, especially after the melting of a spacecraft which landed on Venus, scientists imagined a way to live there. Fifty kilometers above the surface, temperature and atmospheric pressure are more livable. A concept by NASA, called HAVOC (High Altitude Venus Operational Concept), imagines the creation of bases in the clouds of Venus.",
